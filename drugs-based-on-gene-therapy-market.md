<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Drugs Based on Gene Therapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Based on Viral</li><li>Based on Non-viral</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The gene therapy market is primarily categorized into two types: viral and non-viral. Viral gene therapy utilizes modified viruses to deliver therapeutic genes into target cells, effectively exploiting their natural ability to infect and transfer genetic material. In contrast, non-viral gene therapy employs alternative methods, such as electroporation or lipid nanoparticles, to introduce genes without using viruses, often resulting in fewer immune responses. Both approaches aim to treat genetic disorders and enhance therapeutic efficacy in various applications.</p></p>
