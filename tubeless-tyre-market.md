<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tubeless Tyre Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tubeless Tyre</li><li>Bias Tubeless Tyre</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The tubeless tyre market includes two main types: Radial Tubeless Tyres and Bias Tubeless Tyres. Radial tubeless tyres feature layers of fabric cords running perpendicular to the tyre's direction, offering better fuel efficiency, durability, and grip, making them ideal for high-performance vehicles. Bias tubeless tyres have crisscrossed cord layers, providing robust construction and higher load capacity, suitable for heavy-duty applications. Both eliminate the need for inner tubes, reducing puncture risks and improving safety, but differ in design, performance, and application suitability.</p></p>
