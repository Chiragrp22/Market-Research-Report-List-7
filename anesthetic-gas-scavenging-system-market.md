<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anesthetic Gas Scavenging System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Type</li><li>Passive Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The anesthetic gas scavenging system market consists of two main types: active and passive systems. Active scavenging systems utilize a vacuum to actively remove anesthetic gases from the operating room, ensuring effective management and containment of harmful emissions. In contrast, passive systems rely on natural airflow and ventilation to disperse these gases without mechanical assistance. While both types aim to enhance safety and reduce environmental impact, active systems typically offer more controlled and efficient gas removal compared to passive alternatives.</p></p>
