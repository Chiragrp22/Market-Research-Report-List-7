<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heated Swimming Pool Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Heating Equipment</li><li>Direct Heating Equipment</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heated swimming pool equipment market is divided into two main types: indirect heating equipment and direct heating equipment. Indirect heating equipment uses a heat exchanger system, often connected to a boiler or a solar panel, to warm the pool water without direct contact between the heat source and the pool. In contrast, direct heating equipment, such as electric or gas heaters, directly warms the water by passing it through a heating element or burner. Both methods cater to different user needs and efficiency preferences.</p></p>
