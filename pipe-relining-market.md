<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pipe Relining Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cured-in-place</li><li>Pull-in-place</li><li>Pipe Bursting</li><li>Internal Pipe Coating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pipe relining market includes various techniques for repairing and rehabilitating existing pipelines without traditional excavation. Cured-in-place involves inserting a resin-saturated liner that hardens inside the pipe. Pull-in-place is similar but uses a flexible liner pulled into position, then cured. Pipe bursting replaces old pipes by breaking them apart while installing a new one. Internal pipe coating applies a protective layer inside existing pipes to restore flow and prevent corrosion. These methods enhance infrastructure longevity and reduce environmental impact.</p></p>
