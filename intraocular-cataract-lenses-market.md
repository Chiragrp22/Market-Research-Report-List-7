<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intraocular Cataract Lenses Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Foldable Lenses</li><li>Foldable Intraocular Lens</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The intraocular cataract lenses market is primarily divided into two types: non-foldable lenses and foldable lenses. Non-foldable lenses are typically made of rigid materials and require larger incisions for implantation, making them less popular. In contrast, foldable intraocular lenses are made from flexible materials that can be folded for minimally invasive implantation through smaller incisions, leading to quicker recovery times and reduced surgical complications. The growing preference for minimally invasive procedures drives the demand for foldable lenses in the market.</p></p>
